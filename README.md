A simple, free and open-source portal where all of my public social media accounts can be found. The code is also reusable, so others can create their own social portals based on this project (feel free to do so :D).

### Features

- Centralized hub for all social media links.  
- Clean, minimal interface.  
- Fully open-source and easily forkable for personal use.

### Usage

1. **Open Live Version:**  
   [https://nikoboinftb.github.io/links](https://nikoboinftb.github.io/links)  
   Or Download & Run/Edit Locally:  
   The main HTML file is `/links/index.html`, and the main CSS file is `/links/style.css`.

## Open Links

A lightweight tool for opening multiple URLs at once in new tabs. Useful for bulk opening tabs. A great extra tool to use with [Link Gopher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-gopher/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) (just as they likely intended "... or copy and paste into other systems").

### Features

- Open multiple URLs in a single click.  
- Ignores invalid links (must start with `http://` or `https://`).  
- Clean, dark-themed interface.  
- Fully client-side; no data is sent anywhere.  
  - Well, GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so... Download it and run locally if you want FULL privacy.  
  - (And use Linux)

### Usage

1. **Open Live Version:**  
   [https://nikoboinftb.github.io/open-links](https://nikoboinftb.github.io/open-links)  
   Or Download & Run Locally:  
   Clone the repository and open `open-links/index.html`.  
   - Technically even better for privacy, since not even GitHub can track you anymore  

2. Paste URLs (one per line), click **Open All Links**, or **Clear Links** to reset.

### Example input:  
https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB  
https://www.instagram.com/nikoboi  
https://www.youtube.com/@NikoboiNFTB

- Embed multiple video players at once and remove them all with one click.  
- Shows the total number of added players.  
- Supports downloading videos via Video DownloadHelper.

### Usage

   [https://nikoboinftb.github.io/video-player](https://nikoboinftb.github.io/video-player)

2. Paste your URLs, click **Add Players**, then download via Video DownloadHelper.
