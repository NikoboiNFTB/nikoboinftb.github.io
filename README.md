- Clean, minimal interface.  
- Fully open-source and easily forkable for personal use.

1. **Open Live Version:**  
   [https://nikoboi.dev/](https://nikoboi.dev/)  
   Or Download & Run/Edit Locally:  
   The main HTML file is `index.html`, and the main CSS file is `style.css`.

## Open Links

A lightweight tool for opening multiple URLs at once in new tabs. Useful for bulk opening tabs. A great extra tool to use with [Link Gopher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-gopher/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) (just as they likely intended "... or copy and paste into other systems").

### Features

- Open multiple URLs in a single click.  
- Ignores invalid links (must start with `http://` or `https://`).  
- Clean, dark-themed interface.  
- Fully client-side; no data is sent anywhere.  
  - Well, GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so... Download it and run locally if you want FULL privacy.  
  - (And use Linux)

### Usage

1. **Open Live Version:**  
   [https://nikoboi.dev/links](https://nikoboi.dev/links)  
   Or Download & Run Locally:  
   Clone the repository and open `links/index.html`.  
   - Technically even better for privacy, since not even GitHub can track you anymore  

2. Paste URLs (one per line), click **Open All Links**, or **Clear Links** to reset.

### Example input:  
https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB  
https://www.instagram.com/nikoboi  
https://www.youtube.com/@NikoboiNFTB  
(shameless plug)

### Usage
