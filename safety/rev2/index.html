        <h1>Userscript Safety Guide</h1>
        <p>Userscripts can enhance your browsing experience, but they come with risks. Here's how to verify the safety
            of a script before using it.</p>

        <h2>Methods to Verify Userscript Safety</h2>

        <h3>1. Review the Source Code</h3>
        <p>Inspect the source code for suspicious activities like network requests, excessive permissions, or
            obfuscation. Common red flags include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network calls (e.g., <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, <code>fetch</code>)</li>
            <li>Accessing sensitive data (e.g., <code>document.cookie</code>, <code>localStorage</code>)</li>
            <li>Obfuscated code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, this can be quite difficult to do without having extensive JavaScript knowledge already.</p>

        <h3>2. Use the Tampermonkey Script Security Analyzer</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://ilyaxuwu.github.io/tampermonkey/analyze.html" target="_blank">Tampermonkey Userscript
                Analyzer</a> by Liyaa (Ilyax) detects potentially dangerous patterns in the script, like API calls or
            <b>eval()</b> usage. It's not a foolproof solution but can help identify the most common red flags.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Note:</b> It only detects known risky patterns and doesn't analyze the script's logic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Leverage AI for Script Analysis</h3>
        <p>AI can help spot potential issues in short to medium-length scripts, but it's not perfect. Always
            double-check the results with manual inspection.</p>
        <p>Unless you know JavaScript, an LLM is likely your best bet to analyze a scripts behavior. JavaScript is a
            well-documented and a commonly used scripting language. An AI model such as GPT-4 should have no issues
            analyzing the contents of the script.</p>

        <h3>4. Check Ratings, Reviews, and Updates</h3>
        <p>Scripts with positive ratings and recent updates are generally safer. Be cautious of scripts that lack
            documentation or have minimal details, as these could be malicious.</p>

        <h3>5. Test in a Controlled Environment (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Testing a script in a sandbox or virtual machine can help isolate any risks without affecting your main
            system. However, this is not a foolproof method, and may require additional steps like monitoring network
            activity and console logs. For most users, reviewing the script's code directly is simpler and more
            effective than setting up a controlled environment.</p>

        <h3>6. Monitor the Script’s Behavior</h3>
        <p>After installation, keep an eye on the script's behavior. If your browser slows down or you notice abnormal
            behavior, it may indicate a security issue. (Or just a poorly programmed script.)</p>
