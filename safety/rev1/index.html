        <h1>Userscript Safety Guide</h1>

        <h2>
            Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
            Userscripts are powerful tools that can enhance websites, automate tasks, or add extra features. But they
            run directly in your browser, on every site they're allowed on. That's why it’s important to make sure
            they’re safe, especially if you don’t know how to read code yourself. This guide focuses on practical steps
            anyone can follow, without requiring programming knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What Makes a Userscript Unsafe?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Spotting an unsafe userscript can be difficult, but here are a few of the most common features of malicious
            scripts:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Scripts that send data to servers.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripts should always run locally, they have no business phoning anything or anyone.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scripts that run on far more sites than necessary.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a site runs on more sites that it should, that's suspicious.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scripts that include external files from suspicious URLs.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A scritp should always be self container. It should never import any external code.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scripts that are heavily obfuscated or unreadable.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A safe script should have nothing to hide. Obfuscated code is a huge red flag.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            How to Identify a Safe Userscript (Beginner-Friendly Steps)
        </h2>

        <p>
            You don’t need to understand JavaScript to check a script. Here are practical actions anyone can take:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Check the script’s source page:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trusted repositories (GreasyFork, OpenUserJS) show ratings, comments, and update history. Avoid
                        scripts with unclear descriptions or no community feedback.</li>
            </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Look at the “@match” and “@include” lines:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>These tell you which sites the script will run on.
                    A YouTube script should only run on YouTube.
                    If it runs on “*://*/*” (every site), be cautious.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Check “@require” and external URLs:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If a script loads code from another website, that's quite a red flag, since you can't directly read
                    that part of the code.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Check who the author is:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripts from established authors with consistent update history are generally safer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="tools">Tools for Checking Userscripts (No Coding Knowledge Required)</h2>


        <p>
            None of the above are very useful to a non-programmer. How would you know what obfuscation or external files look like?
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are a couple of tools that anyone can use to find out what a userscript does:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Ilyax's Userscript Analyzer</b>:
                <p>A beginner-friendly tool that highlights permissions, external requests, and potential risks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created by <i>Liyaa (Ilyax)</i>.</li>
                    <li>You can analyze a script <a
                            href="https://ilyaxuwu.github.io/tampermonkey/analyze.html">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ask an AI Model</b>:
                <p>Short or medium-sized scripts can be pasted into an AI assistant to explain what they do in plain
                    language. Models that are particularly strong at explaining JavaScript include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ChatGPT (especially GPT-4 or later)</li>
                    <li>Claude</li>
                    <li>Open-source models like Llama 3.1 (for simple scripts)</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These tools let you safely preview the behavior of a script before installation.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Recommended Userscript Managers
        </h2>

        <p>
            Your userscript manager is your first line of defense. Choose one that is transparent and safe:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Violentmonkey (recommended)</b>:
                <p>open-source, privacy-friendly, and available on Firefox
                    <s class="tooltip">and Chromium
                        <span class="tooltiptext">
                            Chromium browsers no longer support Violentmonkey, in their <a
                                href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3"
                                target="_blank">Perennial Quest against user freedom and safety</a>. The same Manifest
                            V3 also killed uBlock Origin, the most popular ad-blocker for the web.
                        </span>
                    </s>.
                    It also makes permission review and version control very clear.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tampermonkey</b>:
                <p>The only popular userscript manager still available on Chromium-based browsers. It is proprietary but
                    feature-rich. If you're on Chrome/Edge/Brave, it's a common choice, but review permissions
                    carefully.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For maximum safety, Firefox + Violentmonkey is an excellent combination.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Safe Installation & Update Practices
        </h2>

        <p>
            A few simple habits can keep you safe when using userscripts:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Install thoughtfully:</b>
                <p>Even for fun scripts, check them with an analyzer or AI tool first
                    (see <a href="#tools">Tools for Checking Userscripts</a>).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Keep your userscript manager updated:</b>
                <p>This ensures security patches are applied. Firefox + Violentmonkey is the recommended combination;
                    Tampermonkey is required for Chromium.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Review permissions after updates:</b>
                <p>Make sure the script hasn’t added new sites or external files
                    unexpectedly.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Disable auto-updates for trusted scripts if desired:</b>
                <p>Only necessary if you want to prevent
                    unexpected changes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Final Thoughts
        </h2>

        <p>
            Userscripts are powerful, fun, and incredibly customizable. With a few simple habits, checking
            permissions, scanning scripts with user friendly tools, using trusted managers, and monitoring updates, you
            can enjoy userscripts confidently and safely, even without coding experience.
