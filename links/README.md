## Open Links

A lightweight tool for opening multiple URLs at once in new tabs. Useful for bulk opening tabs. A great extra tool to use with [Link Gopher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-gopher/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) (just as they likely intended "... or copy and paste into other systems").

### Features

- Open multiple URLs in a single click.
- Ignores invalid links (must start with `http://` or `https://`).
- Clean, dark-themed interface.
- Fully client-side; no data is sent anywhere.

### Usage

**Option 1**. Open Live Version:

[https://nikoboi.dev/links](https://nikoboi.dev/links)

**Option 2**. Download and Run locally (recommended):

1. Create a folder anywhere, open the terminal in it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/nikoboinftb.github.io
cd nikoboinftb.github.io
```

2. Start a Python server (this is local):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 5500
```

>> Requires Python

3. Then just open in your browser: [http://localhost:5500/links/](http://localhost:5500/links/)
```bash
firefox http://localhost:5500/links/
```

4. Paste URLs (one per line), click **Open All Links**, or **Clear Links** to reset.

**Example input**:
```text
https://www.instagram.com/nikoboi
https://www.youtube.com/@NikoboiNFTB
