# Home

A simple, free and open-source portal where all of my projects and social media accounts can be found. The code is easily tweakable, so others can create their own social portals based on this project (feel free to do so :D). Most socials have icons in [`/assets/svg/brand/`](assets/svg/brand).

## Features

- Centralized hub for all social media links.
- Clean, minimal interface.
- Fully open-source and easily forkable for personal use.

## Usage

## Usage

**Option 1**. Open Live Version:

[https://nikoboi.dev/encrypt/](https://nikoboi.dev/encrypt/)

**Option 2**. Download and Run/Edit locally:

1. Create a folder anywhere, open the terminal in it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/nikoboinftb.github.io .
```

>> Using `.` clones the files into the current directory. So create the folder first.

2. Open the folder in any code editor, example using VSCodium:

```bash
codium .
```
